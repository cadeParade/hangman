JS:
Build a function that takes a word and coverts to an object where the keys are the letters and the values is an array of the indices of the letter in the word. Ex: For the word 'balloon' the object would look like:
{ b: [0],
  a: [1],
  l: [2,3],
  o: [4,5],
  n: [6]
 }

Build function that returns true if an input letter is in an input string and false if not
ex: my_function('a', 'balloon') returns true, my_function('x', 'balloon') returns false. Extra credit: ternary operator

Build a function that takes a string and returns false if the string is:
  more than one character,
  less than one character
  a number,
  extra credit: punctuation

Build a function that takes a word and generates one div (in string form) for each letter in the word. Inside each div is an underscore with spaces around it -- " _ ". EX: my_function('cat') returns "<div> _ </div><div> _ </div><div> _ </div>"
